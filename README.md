# jclay-dev-journal
A place for journaling development work. I work on mostly on Windows 10, with CUDA, and CMake so most topics will be related to those tools.

## Journals:
- [Using CUDA with CMake, Ninja and Windows 10](cmake-cuda-ninja.md)
- [Setting proper include directories with CMake, CUDA, and Visual Studio 2017](cmake-cuda-visual-studio-include-dirs.md)
- [Creating a C++ development environment on Windows 10 with zsh](windows-10-cpp-zsh-development-environment.md)
- [Towards a sane Windows 10 C++/CUDA/CMake development experience](towards-sane-windows-cpp-development.md)
- [Enabling Parallel Builds with CMake and MSVC](cmake-enable-parallel-build-msvc.md)
- [CMake with Qt 5.10](cmake-qt5-10.md)
- [Qt3D Per Frame Callback](qt3d-per-frame-callback.md)
- [Drawing Points with Qt3D](draw-points-qt3d.md)
